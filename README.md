# Week-2-Progress
Documentation of what I have learnt int he week 30th March to 6th April 2020 

In this week ,an assignment was given which consisted of 4 questions based on python basics and python libraries namely
numpy ,scipy and matplotlib.

The question which I undertook was about denoising the image.There was an image with salt and pepper noise.The task was to minimize this noise.This was dine by the algorithm that they have mentioned.It included keeping record of black_count, white_count,mid_count,Mid_total and then recontructing final matrix.
There were many values of pixels for the single position.The challenge was how to asssign a particular value of pixel at that
particular position.Hence,in order to write this program,i wrote a code which included many functions of numpy.I learnt the use of conditions imposing through boolean values,use of a.any fuction,etc.

My teammates namely Ayush Shrivastava,Harsh Kumar,Nirmal Shah did the rest thre questions of assignment.Ankit kumar Jain helped me a lot for debugging in question 2.I thank him a lot.We all did the assignment very well.
I learnt a lot of good stuff during this week.
